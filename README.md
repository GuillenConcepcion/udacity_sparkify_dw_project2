# The Sparkfy 
Sparkify is a music streming startup with many daily listeners. Sparkfy's databases grew over time and the need arose to move this data to a cloud environment.
So the goal of this project is to move their process and data to this new enviroment.

# Datasets
Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
There are two datasets :

- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

To properly read log data s3://udacity-dend/log_data, it is need following metadata file:
Log metadata: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```sh
            song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
            song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```sh
{
"num_songs": 1,
"artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
"artist_latitude": null, 
"artist_longitude": null,
"artist_location": "", 
"artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
"song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
"title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
"duration": 152.92036, "year": 0
}    
```

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```sh
        log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
        log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
